 <p>We have an idea, we code it as a custom task in our `Gruntfile.js` andâ€¦ *it works*!</p><p>Then we sleep on it for 6 months and someone stumble on us, revealing some software weakness we have trouble to fix **because we don&#39;t remember well** what was our state of mind at the time of writing the code.</p><p>*This is not bad*. This is how it often works in the *real world*.  <br>We will learn how to make that **code beautifully speaking by itself**, embracing a *design features* approach rather than the *code stuff tested on runtime* one.</p><p>And if you never wrote *unit tests*, this is definitely the trigger which **will break your fear** and share your knowledge of your code across your team.</p>
