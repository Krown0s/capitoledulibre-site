 <p>One of the primary issues with Lua in the wild is the lack of standardized batteries included distribution. Creating and maintaining a distribution that is as portable and flexible as Lua is challenging, especially for modules that depend on external libraries. Solutions to this problem are partially available in form of the LuaRocks and LuaDist projects, however there are still some standing issues that have to be addressed. This talk will summarize the challenges of building multi-platform Lua distributions and provide some insight into the planned unification between the two most prominent package management systems in the Lua ecosystem.</p>
