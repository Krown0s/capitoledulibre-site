 <p>Lua is part of the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD operating system</a>.
 It is not only used to script programs in userspace, but also to run Lua
 code in kernel space.  What sounds bold at first sight allows for
 interesting experiments, e.g. rapid system code development, ideal for
 prototypes, proof of concepts and such.
 In this talk, I'll give an overview of the current state of Lua
 in NetBSD, the components and NetBSD specific bindings, and what
 generally can be done using the NetBSD and Lua combination.</p>
