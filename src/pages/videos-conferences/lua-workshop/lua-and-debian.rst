 <p>Debian is a free OS distribution on which more than 120 derivatives are based. It distributes around 20K different softwares, precompiled and packaged for an average of 10 architectures. Lua is part of it, and the 5.1 runtime counts more than 100K installations (in Debian, 10 times more in Ubuntu, ...). In this talk I describe how Lua fits in this picture, and how the peculiarities of Lua make it easy or hard to package it and its libraries for a mainstream software distribution like Debian.</p>
