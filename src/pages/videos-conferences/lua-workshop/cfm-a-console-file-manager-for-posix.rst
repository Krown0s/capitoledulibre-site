 <p>CFM is a text-based file manager for POSIX-compatible systems, written in just 750 lines of Lua, using the 'posix' and 'curses' libraries. CFM emphasises a clean uncluttered display and simple ergonomic interaction, while providing a good range of useful facilities. This talk firstly demonstrates the features of CFM and then presents several observations on the use and advantages of Lua in developing this software.</p>
