 <p>In order to create highly customizable BACnet OEM solutions we integrated a Lua runtime into our building controllers. From within this runtime you have access to our BACnet stack (ASHRAE/ANSI 135-2010; ISO 16484-5) and can interact with internal and external BACnet objects and devices. Each Lua instance is part of the BACnet stack itself and can be controlled with the BACnet protocol. Furthermore, it is possible to use Lua for diagnostics, tests and one-time tasks since each instance is equipped with shell access via telnet.</p>
