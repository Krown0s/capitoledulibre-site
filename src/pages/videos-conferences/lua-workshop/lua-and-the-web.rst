 <p>The Web is the biggest platform in the world and it can now be scripted in Lua. Anything that has been created in JavaScript can be created using Lua too, with the help of a lightweight virtual machine called Moonshine. In this talk I'll introduce Moonshine and walk you through how to get started with Lua in the browser. We'll write some code, create some APIs, explore the debugger and discover a few things that are now possible with Lua and the Web.</p>
