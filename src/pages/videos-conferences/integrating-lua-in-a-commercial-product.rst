 <p>arcapos is a commercial point of sale solution for retail and ticketing with a focus on ease of use, speed, and stability. The frontend can be extended using the Lua language, the backoffice parts are written to 90% in Lua. With integrating Lua we had two things in mind: Allow us to quickly react to customer requests, and, allow experienced users and resellers to change the system. This is a (technical) talk about how we integrated Lua into the arcapos point of sale solution. This is not a marketing talk, of course, but rather technical issues we faced, how we solved them, code examples (both C and Lua) etc.</p>
