 <p>This is a talk on LuaRocks, the package manager for Lua modules.
 <a href="http://luarocks.org/">LuaRocks</a> was first released in 2007 and currently features over
 300 projects in its repository. The focus of the talk will be on the
 history of LuaRocks so far, its current status and latest
 developments, including possibilities for changes, especially
 revisions in the rockspec format. The idea is to hopefully open a
 discussion with the community with regard to future directions.
 (An accompanying article on the history of LuaRocks is
 <a href="http://luarocks.org/doc/history.pdf">available</a>.)</p>
